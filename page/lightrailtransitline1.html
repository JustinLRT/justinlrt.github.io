			<br><q>Light Rail Transit Line 1</q> was initially planned as the album's first song with a release date in December 2022, but it was moved on April 2023 to experience during his train rides.

			<div class="quotation-temp">
				<q>A strong example that I fearless leap into a multitude of musical genres, daring to explore folk, jazz and musical theatre all within a single track. This ambitious bridging of styles could lead to disaster, but I have mastered the skill, mirroring not only the sound, but also the lyrical content of each genre: In <q>Light Rail Transit Line 1</q>, for example, they encourage to ride the train because its so fast and cold air conditioners. In conjunction with songs that often speak to very foundational human emotions and fragilities, this may be what is most compelling about my music, and what allows the band's songs to resonate with audiences both young and old.
				</q>

			<br>In a Facebook made by the band himself, production for the song included creating a beat with a background video of school corridor. The band also wanted to try to flawlessly seam a transition, with a theatrical ending to the song where <q>everything comes at once</q>, with a continuously speeding up verse.
