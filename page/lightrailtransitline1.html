		<div class="content">
			<br><q>Light Rail Transit Line 1</q> was initially planned as the album's third song with a release date in December 2022, but it was moved on January 2023 to experience during his train rides. The song speaks about to encourage to ride LRT-1 train, for example, <q>Gusto mo bang sumakay sa Light Rail Transit Line 1</q>. The music features transitions between a violin, a trumpet, and a piano. The song is described as, according to his classmates.
			<br>
			<br>
			<q>A strong example that I fearless leap into a multitude of musical genres, daring to explore folk, jazz and musical theatre all within a single track. This ambitious bridging of styles could lead to disaster, but I have mastered the skill, mirroring not only the sound, but also the lyrical content of each genre: In <q>Light Rail Transit Line 1</q>, for example, they encourage to ride the train because its so fast and cold air conditioners. In conjunction with songs that often speak to very foundational human emotions and fragilities, this may be what is most compelling about Justin's music, and what allows the band's songs to resonate with audiences both young and old.</q>
			<br>
			<br>In a YouTube made by the band himself, production for the song included creating a beat with a background video that showing LRT-1 trains. To make background vocals, a vocoder was used. The band also wanted to try to flawlessly seam a transition from a violin to vocals to a guitar, with a theatrical ending to the song where <q>everything comes at once</q>, with a continuously speeding up verse.
