					Asia World station during the construction in April 2023
				</div>
				<br>
			</div>
			The station, known as Asia World station (after the Asiaworld development, its location) during its inception, was first planned as part of the Line 1 South Extension plan, which calls for a mostly elevated extension of approximately 11.7 kilometers. The extension will have 8 passenger stations with an option for 2 future stations (Manuyo Uno and Talaba). The project was first approved on August 25, 2000, and the implementing agreement for the project was approved on January 22, 2002. However, construction for the extension was repeatedly delayed until the project was shelved years later.
			<br>
			<br>The plans for the southern extension project were restarted as early as 2012 during the Benigno Aquino III administration and was expected to begin construction in 2014, but was delayed due to right of way issues. The issues were resolved in 2016 and the project broke ground on May 4, 2017. Meanwhile, construction works on the south extension began on May 7, 2019, after the right of way acquisitions were cleared.
			<br>
			<br>Nearing the end of the the construction, the station was officially renamed as PITX station, after the nearby Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange (PITX), although the old name is still shown on signages at the station.
			<br>
			<br>On November 15, 2024, Phase 1 of the extension, where the station is part of, was inaugurated by President Bongbong Marcos; the LRMC management announced the start of its commercial operations to be on the following day.

			</div>
			Asia World station is accessible from Kennedy Road at ground level or from the third level of PITX, which is linked to the west platform. The two platforms are connected by a pedestrian overpass crossing the two tracks inside the station, allowing commuters to catch a train going in the opposite direction without paying a new fare. Staircases, escalators (also installed at other LRT-1 extension stations), and elevators connect the platforms to the concourse on the ground level. Ticket booths are located on the ground-level concourse and next to the west platform, respectively. Public restrooms, lactation room, and first-aid room are also found inside the station.
