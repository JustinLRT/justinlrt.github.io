		<div class="content">
			<br>Niog station was first planned as part of the Line 1 South Extension, which calls for a mostly elevated extension of approximately 11.7 kilometers. The extension will have 8 passenger stations with an option for 2 future stations (Manuyo Uno and Talaba). The project was first approved on August 25, 2000 and the implementing agreement for the project was approved on January 22, 2002. However, construction for the extension was repeatedly delayed until the project was shelved years later.
			<br>
			<br>The plans for the southern extension project were restarted as early as 2012 during the Aquino administration and was expected to begin construction in 2014, but was delayed due to right of way issues. The issues were resolved in 2016 and the project broke ground on May 4, 2017. Meanwhile, construction works on the south extension began on May 7, 2019 after the right-of-way acquisitions were cleared.
			<br>
			<br>As of July 27, 2023, the project is 88% complete. The extension is slated for partial operations by late 2024 or early 2025 and full operations by second quarter of 2027.
