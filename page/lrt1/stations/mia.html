			<br>The station is named after the nearby road formerly called MIA Road, which was renamed NAIA Road after the namesake airport's name change in 1987. Despite being at the intersection of Seaside Drive (NAIA Road's physical continuation to Bay City) and Roxas Boulevard and not within the airport complex, the station retains the MIA designation. In addition, Ninoy Aquino Avenue station is located closer to NAIA Terminal 1. It was officially named MIA station before the inauguration of the Cavite Extension Phase 1 in 2024.

			The plan to build a station near NAIA Road was first introduced in the 1990s as part of the proposed MRT Line 6, which would run from Baclaran to either Zapote in Bacoor or Dasmariñas. It was known as International Terminal station and later NAIA Road station.
			<br>
			<br>The plan was later revived as part of the Line 1 South Extension plan, which calls for a mostly elevated extension of approximately 11.7 kilometers. The extension will have 8 passenger stations with an option for 2 future stations (Manuyo Uno and Talaba). The project was first approved on August 25, 2000, and the implementing agreement for the project was approved on January 22, 2002. However, construction for the extension was repeatedly delayed until the project was shelved years later.
			<br>
			<br>The plans for the southern extension project were restarted as early as 2012 during the Benigno Aquino III administration and was expected to begin construction in 2014, but was delayed due to right-of-way issues. The issues were resolved in 2016 and the project broke ground on May 4, 2017. Meanwhile, construction works on the south extension began on May 7, 2019 after the right of way acquisitions were cleared.
