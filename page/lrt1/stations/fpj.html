			<h2>Initial planning and construction</h2>
			The station was first planned for the second phase of the MRT Line 3, known as Muñoz station. The second phase would have extended the MRT Line 3 from its northern terminus at North Avenue to Monumento to create a seamless rail loop around Metro Manila. The station was planned to be located near the San Francisco del Monte River.
			<br>
			<br>The second phase of the MRT-3 was shelved in favor of the Line 1 North Extension Project, a 5.4-kilometer extension of LRT-1 to the North Avenue station of MRT Line 3 as part of the MRT-LRT closing the loop project to integrate the operations of the Line 1 and Line 3. The station site was changed from the San Francisco del Monte River to the front of WalterMart North EDSA. However, the integration of MRT-3 and LRT-1 operations did not happen until the expected partial opening of the North Triangle Common Station in 2023. Construction of the North Extension started in July 2008 and was completed in 2010. Roosevelt station was opened on October 22, 2010.
			<br>
			<br>The station was named after Roosevelt Avenue, which was in turn named in honor of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The avenue was later renamed Fernando Poe Jr. Avenue on December 10, 2021.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Temporary closure</h2>
			On August 7, 2020, it was announced that Roosevelt station would be temporarily closed from September 5. As part of the construction of the North Triangle Common Station, the tracks extending eastward from Roosevelt station have to be realigned in order to provide the necessary connection to the Common Station. Hence, during this temporary closure, Balintawak station would once again serve as the northern terminus of the line. Originally scheduled until December 8, 2020, the temporary closure was later extended until further notice.
			<br>
			<br>On November 26, 2022, the Light Rail Manila Corporation announced the planned reopening of Roosevelt station on December 5, 2022, pending testing and system adaptation to the new signaling system; they followed up and confirmed that the reopening would proceed as scheduled.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Renaming</h2>
			On August 20, 2023, Roosevelt station was renamed Fernando Poe Jr. station after the Filipino actor.
