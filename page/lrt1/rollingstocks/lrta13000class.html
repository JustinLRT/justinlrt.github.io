			<br>Purchased in 2017 with Japanese funding as part of the south extension of the line, the trains, manufactured by CAF, entered service in July 2023 to replace the aging first-generation 1000 class trains.
			<br>
			<br>It is the first LRV in the system with 5 digits in the body number due to the class fleet exceeding 99 units, in comparison to the older fleet.

			<br><h2>Purchase</h2>
			To prepare for the construction of the south extension of the LRT Line 1 to Cavite, new trains were needed to meet the growing demand. As such, on October 16, 2015, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) called for bids for the purchase of 120 light rail vehicles, configurable to thirty four-car trainsets, with Japanese companies only allowed to participate in the tender, In February, DOTC identified Marubeni and Sumitomo Corporation as prospective bidders. However, in April, the DOTC announced a failed bidding as none of them submitted proposals.
			<br>
			<br>On December 28, 2016, the Department of Transportation (DOTr), called for bids again. Two bidders showed up: Marubeni with Hyundai Rotem, and Mitsubishi Corporation with Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF). The latter won the ₱14.1 billion contract on November 19, 2017, and the contract was signed on December 1. These trains are expected to gradually replace the aging 1000 class which has been in use since the opening of the line in 1984 and has undergone three refurbishments.
			<br>
			<br>Mitsubishi implemented the contract and supplied the trains while CAF manufactured the trains. The new trains were funded by Japan's official development assistance.
			<br>

			<h2>Production and commissioning</h2>

				Mock-up model of the 13000 class
			</div>
			<br>Officials of the Department of Transportation (DOTr) unveiled a full-scale mock-up model of the 13000 class train on May 7, 2019.
			<br>
			<br>The first two sets (8 cars) were initially planned to be delivered in July 2020, however the delivery of the train sets were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
			<br>
			<br>On January 18, 2021, the first batch of deliveries, consisting of the first trainset (4 cars consisting of two articulated cars each) arrived at the Port of Manila. These were unveiled to the public the following January 26. This trainset was then transported to Baclaran Depot in February.
			<br>
			<br>The first trainset underwent static tests at the depot on September 15, 2021, followed by dynamic tests along the mainline on September 25. The trains then underwent 1,000-kilometer test runs conducted by the Light Rail Manila Corporation on May 4, 2022. Initially expected to enter in-service operations by the end of the month, the initial deadline was not met.

			</div>
			<br>On July 19, 2023, the trains were inaugurated by President Bongbong Marcos. The first train set entered revenue service the next day. More trainsets from the 13000 class are expected to be incrementally entered into service, with one additional train set every week until every trainset enters service. All trains are expected to enter service by the fourth quarter of 2024, once the Cavite extension phase 1 is opened. As of December 23, 2024, 23 trainsets have been deployed for revenue service.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Water leaks</h2>
			A few months before the trains entered service, Transportation Undersecretary for Railways Cesar Chavez disclosed on February 16, 2023, that water leaks were found in eighty LRVs that were delivered to the Philippines. He further disclosed that as a result, these could not be used in mainline operations, and the government suspended payments to Mitsubishi and CAF in July 2022.
			<br>
			<br>Chavez admitted that as a result of travel restrictions caused by the pandemic, the DOTr was unable to send inspection teams to inspect the trains for any defects, while these were still undergoing factory acceptance tests. These defects were later fixed through a comprehensive roof rectification plan.

			<br>The train car body is made of stainless steel. Each vehicle has four pocket doors per side. Initially, the trains were to sport a silver-yellow livery, but was changed to crimson and silver after the mock-up model was unveiled in 2019.

			<h3>Front cab variations</h3>
			The fourth-generation trains vary in two frame colors. The first two sets (Trainsets 1 & 2), built in Spain, have a red-painted "forehead" above the windshield and LED sign, while sets 3 to 30, built in Mexico, received a black "forehead".
			<br>
			<br>Some train sets has varying signage data as well; train sets that arrived and/or were certified prior to the renaming of Roosevelt station to Fernando Poe Jr. station retained its destination signage. Later train sets feature the correct destination name which is noted to scroll instead of being static. All train sets had its signage data been updated in preparation for opening of the Cavite Extension Phase 1.

			<h2>Interior</h2>
			As opposed to the older rolling stock, the 13000 class includes hand straps aside from safety handrails installed above the train floor.
			<br>
			<br>The trains are also the first in the Philippines to feature a specially-made wheelchair-compatible space or passenger with restricted mobility areas, located closer to the driver's cab as compared to the 1100 class and 1200 class where it is located near the articulation. Unlike the 1200 class, there are also fewer side handrails in the middle sections of each vehicle. Longitudinal seating is present in the 13000 class, as per other train classes in the system.
			<br>
			<br>Like the 1100 class and 1200 class, there are four pocket-type doors per side per car. For the driving cars, one door is installed on the side of the driving cab.

			<h2>Electrical and mechanical</h2>
			Each LRV has three inside-frame bogies consisting of two motorized bogies at the ends and a Jacobs trailer bogie under the articulation. Semi-permanent couplers are installed at the ends of every light rail vehicle, except for the driving cab section of the head car.
			<br>
			<br>These trains are easily recognizable by their distinctive braking sounds, which produce a screeching noise when stopping. This trait was not present in earlier train class sets, even when they were first introduced.
			<br>
			<br>Like the 1100 class and 1200 class, each LRV consists of four 105-kilowatt 3-phase AC induction motors, driven by variable-voltage/variable-frequency drive (VVVF) inverters with insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBT). Auxiliary power is sourced from a static inverter, a low-power DC voltage supply, and batteries.

			<h2>Signaling and control systems</h2>
			The trains are equipped with the automatic train protection (ATP) system. Alstom was awarded the signaling and communications contract for the south extension of the LRT Line 1 in 2016. The contractual scope included the upgrading of the signaling system and the installation of the Atlas 100 on-board signaling solution for 60 train sets across the existing three generations of trains and the 13000 class trains.
			<br>
			<br>The trains are also equipped with a Train Control and Monitoring System (TCMS).
