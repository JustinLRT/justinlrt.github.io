Purchased in 2017 as part of the south extension of the line, the trains entered service in July 2023 to replace the aging first-generation 1000 class trains.

		<button class="collapsible">Purchase</button>
		<div class="content">
			<br>To prepare for the construction of the LRT Line 1 Cavite extension, new trains were needed to meet the growing demand. A bidding for the purchase of 120 light rail vehicles (30 four-car train sets) was conducted from October 2015 to February 2016, with Japanese companies only allowed to participate in the auction. Marubeni Corporation and Sumitomo Corporation expressed interest to participate in the auction. However, the first bidding failed as no bidders submitted proposals.
			<br>
			<br>The second bidding was conducted in 2017. The bidders included Marubeni Corporation with Hyundai Rotem and Mitsubishi Corporation with Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF). Mitsubishi and CAF was awarded the JPY 30 billion (₱ 14.1 billion) contract in November 2017, and the contract was signed by the Department of Transportation and Mitsubishi Corporation on December 1. Mitsubishi Corporation is the implementing contractor of the procurement project while Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles manufacturered the trains. These trains are expected to gradually replace the aging 1000 class which has been in use since the opening of the line in 1984 and has undergone three refurbishments.
			<br>
			<br>The purchase of the trains was funded by Japan's official development assistance.
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">Design</button>
		<div class="content">
			<br>The LRV design is a 6-axle rigid body consisting of two articulated cars, like those of the 1100 and 1200 class trains.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Car body</h2>
			The train car body is made of stainless steel. Each LRV has four sliding pocket-type doors per side. The trains will also feature air-conditioning, LED destination panels and LED lighting in the trains' interiors and exteriors. The trains also sport a livery of crimson and silver.
			<br>

				Light indicator above an open door of the 13000 class
			</div>
			<br>
			<h2>Interior</h2>
			As opposed to the older rolling stock, the 13000 class includes hand straps aside from safety handrails installed above the train floor.
			<br>
			<br>The trains are also the first in the Philippines to feature a specially-made wheelchair-compatible space or passenger with restricted mobility (PRM) areas, located closer to the driver's cab as compared to the 1100 class and 1200 class where it is located near the articulation. Unlike the 1200 class, there are also fewer side handrails in the middle sections of each vehicle. Longitudinal seating is present in the 13000 class, as per other train classes in the system.
			<br>
			<br>Like the 1100 class and 1200 class, there are four pocket-type doors per side per car. For the driving cars, one door will be installed on the side of the driving cab.

			<br>
			<h2>Mechanical</h2>
			The bogies are of inside-frame type, similar to the 1000 class. Like all LRT Line 1 rolling stock, the wheel diameter is 660 millimeters. Each LRV has three bogies consisting of two motorized bogies, at the ends and one trailer bogie under the articulation.
			<br>
			<br>Semi-permanent couplers are installed at the ends of every light rail vehicle, except for the driving cab section of the head car.
			<br>
			<br>These trains are easily recognizable by their distinctive braking sounds, which produce a screeching noise when stopping. This trait was not present in earlier train class sets, even when they were first introduced.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Traction and auxiliaries</h2>
			Like the second and third-generation trains, the IGBT–VVVF traction control system will be used. The traction motors consist of four 3-phase AC induction motors.
			<br>
			<br>The auxiliaries consists of a static inverter, a low-power DC voltage supply, and batteries.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Signalling and control systems</h2>
			The trains are equipped with the automatic train protection (ATP) system. Alstom was awarded the signalling and communications contract for the south extension of the LRT Line 1 in 2016. The contractual scope included the upgrading of the signalling system and the installation of the Atlas 100 on-board signalling solution for 60 train sets across the existing three generations of trains and the 13000 class trains.
			<br>
			<br>The trains are also equipped with a Train Control and Monitoring System (TCMS).

			<h2>Variations</h2>
			The fourth-generation trains vary in two frame colors. The first 2 sets were built in Spain, and have a red-painted "forehead" above the windshield and LED sign, while sets 3 to 30, built in Mexico, received a black "forehead".
		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">Operations</button>
		<div class="content">
			<br>The first two sets (8 cars) were initially planned to be delivered in July 2020, however the delivery was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
			<br>
			<br>On January 18, 2021, the first batch of deliveries, consisting of the first trainset (4 cars consisting of two articulated cars each) arrived at the Port of Manila. The new trains were unveiled to the public on January 26, 2021. The delivery of the trains are expected to be completed in June 2022, with at least one trainset arriving every month until the deliveries are completed.
			<br>
			<br>The trains underwent 1,000-kilometer test runs since May 2022. Initially expected to enter in-service operations by the end of the month, it did not push through. A few months before entering service, water leaks were found in twenty train sets or eighty cars, which were later fixed through a comprehensive roof rectification plan. After repeated delays, the first train entered revenue service on July 20, 2023, after the trains were inaugurated by President Bongbong Marcos the previous day. More trainsets from the 13000 class are expected to be incrementally entered into service, with one additional train set every week until December 2023.
