			<h2>Overview of our policies and how we enforce them</h2>
			We strive to support a healthy digital advertising ecosystem — one that's trustworthy and transparent, and works for users, advertisers, and publishers. The purpose is to help you build Justin LRT ad campaigns that align with our advertising policies listed below.
			<br>
			<br>These policies are designed to ensure a safe and positive experience for our users and abide by applicable laws. This means that our policies prohibit content that is harmful to users and the overall advertising ecosystem.
			<br>
			<br>Our advertising policies cover 4 broad areas:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Prohibited content</b>: Content you can't advertise on this site.
				</li>
				<li><b>Prohibited practices</b>: Things you can't do if you want to advertise with us.</li>
				<li><b>Restricted content and features</b>: Content you can advertise, but with limitations.</li>
				<li><b>Editorial and technical</b>: Quality standards for your ads, websites, and apps.</li>
				<li type="none"><br>Go through the policies below for policy definitions, examples, and troubleshooting steps.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>We use human evaluation to ensure that ads comply with these policies. Our enforcement technologies use human reviewers’ decisions, to help protect our users and keep our ad platforms safe. More complex, nuanced or severe cases are often reviewed and evaluated by our specially-trained experts.
			<br>
			<br>We take action on content that violates our policies. This may include disapproving violating ads so they don’t serve, as well as suspending accounts for repeat or egregious violations. We take repeat violations of our policies seriously and continue to expand a strike system for repeat offenders.
			<br>
			<br>We will provide you with information on our decision for any policy violation enforcement actions we take.

			<h2>Counterfeit goods</h2>
			Justin LRT prohibits the sale or promotion for sale of counterfeit goods.

		</div>
		<button class="collapsible">Restricted content and features</button>
		<div class="content">
			<br>The policies below cover content that is sometimes legally or culturally sensitive. Online advertising can be a powerful way to reach customers, but in sensitive areas, we also work hard to avoid showing these ads when and where they might be inappropriate.
			<br>
			<br>For that reason, we allow the promotion of the content below, but on a limited basis. These promotions may not show to every user in every location, and advertisers may need to meet additional requirements before their ads are eligible to run. Note that not all ad products, features, or networks are able to support this restricted content.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Default ad treatment</h2>
			Justin LRT is committed to delivering a safe and trustworthy ad experience for all users. That’s why we limit serving certain types of ad categories.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Sexual content</h2>
			Ads should respect  preferences and comply with legal regulations, so we don't allow certain kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations.  Some kinds of sexual content in ads and destinations are allowed only if they comply with the policies below and don't target minors, but they will only show in limited scenarios based on user search queries, user age, and local laws where the ad is being served.
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul type="none">
				<li>
					Examples of restricted sexual content:
					<ul>
						<li>Visible genitalia and female breasts</li>

						<li>Models in sexualized poses</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>Alcohol</h2>
			We abide by local alcohol laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of alcohol-related advertising, both for alcohol and drinks that resemble alcohol. Some types of alcohol-related ads are allowed if they meet the policies below, don’t target minors, and target only countries that are explicitly allowed to show alcohol ads.
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul type="none">
				<li>
					Examples of restricted alcoholic beverages:
					<ul>
						<li>Beer</li>

					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>Copyrights</h2>

If you are legally authorized to use copyrighted content, must comply the law of copyright to advertise. If you see unauthorized content, <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">please contract us</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Gambling and games</h2>
			We support responsible gambling advertising and abide by local gambling laws and industry standards, so we don’t allow certain kinds of gambling-related advertising. Gambling-related ads are allowed if they comply with the policies below and the advertiser has received the proper Justin LRT ad certification. Gambling ads must target approved countries, have a landing page that displays information about responsible gambling, and never target minors. Check local regulations for the areas you want to target.
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul type="none">
				<li>
					Examples of restricted gambling-related content:
					<ul>
						<li>Physical casinos</li>
						<li>Sites where users can bet on poker, bingo, roulette, or sports events</li>

						<li>Sites offering <q>poker-for-fun</q> games</li>
						<li>Online educational materials for casino-based games</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>Healthcare and medicines</h2>
			We are dedicated to following advertising regulations for healthcare and medicine, so we expect that ads and destinations follow appropriate laws and industry standards. Some healthcare-related content can’t be advertised at all, while others can only be advertised if the advertiser is certified with Justin LRT and targets only approved countries. Check local regulations for the areas you want to target.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Political content</h2>
			We support responsible political advertising and expect all political ads and destinations to comply with local campaign and election laws for any areas they target. This policy includes legally mandated election <q>silence periods.</q>
			<br>
			<br>
			<ul type="none">
				<li>
					Examples of political content:
					<ul>
						<li>Political issue advocacy</li>
						<li>Promotion of political parties or candidates</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h2>Financial services</h2>
			We want users to have adequate information to make informed financial decisions. Our policies are designed to give users information to weigh the costs associated with financial products and services, and to protect users from harmful or deceitful practices. For the purposes of this policy, we consider financial products and services to be those related to the management or investment of money and cryptocurrencies, including personalized advice.
			<br>
			<br>When promoting financial products and services, you must comply with state and local regulations for any location that your ads target — for example, include specific disclosures required by local law. Advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Trademark</h2>
			There are multiple factors that determine when trademarks can be used in ads. These policies apply only when a trademark owner has submitted a valid complaint to Justin LRT.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Legal requirements</h2>
			You’re always responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations, in addition to Justin LRT's advertising policies, for all of the locations where your ads are showing.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Other restricted businesses</h2>
			We restrict certain kinds of businesses from advertising with us to prevent users from being exploited, even if individual businesses appear to comply with our other policies. Based on our own continuous reviews, and feedback from users, regulators, and consumer protection authorities, we occasionally identify products or services that are prone to abuse. If we feel that certain kinds of businesses pose an unreasonable risk to user safety or user experience, then we may limit or stop related ads from running.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Restricted ad formats and features</h2>
			There are multiple factors that determine access to advanced ad formats and features. Certain ad formats are not available for all advertisers until they meet our specific requirements or complete the certification process.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Ad-serving protections for children and teens</h2>
			It’s important that our advertising experience on Justin LRT products is useful, informative, and above all, safe for all our users, and that includes children and teens, too. Justin LRT’s child and teen ads policy implement safeguards to help protect users under age of 18 years, including disabling ads personalization and restricting sensitive ad categories.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Limited ad serving</h2>
			To protect the integrity of our ad ecosystem, we limit impressions of ads that have a higher potential of causing abuse or a poor experience for our users. In these specific instances, only qualified advertisers will be able to serve ads without impression limits. Learn more about when limited ad serving applies and who is a qualified advertiser.

		<button class="collapsible">Editorial & technical requirements</button>

			<br>We want to deliver ads that are engaging for users without being annoying or difficult to interact with, so we've developed editorial requirements to help keep your ads appealing to users.

		<button class="collapsible">About our policies</button>
		<div class="content">
			<br>Justin LRT enables businesses of all sizes, from around the world, to promote a wide variety of products, services, applications, and websites on this site by placing ad. We want to help you reach existing and potential customers and audiences. However, to help create a safe and positive experience for users, we listen to their feedback and concerns about the types of ads they see. We also regularly review changes in online trends and practices, industry norms, and regulations. And finally, in crafting our policies, we also think about our values and culture as a company, as well as operational, technical, and business considerations. As a result, we have created a set of policies that apply to all promotions on this site.
			<br>
			<br>Justin LRT requires that advertisers comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Justin LRT policies described above. It's important that you familiarize yourself with and keep up to date on these requirements for the places where your business operates, as well as any other places your ads are showing. When we find content that violates these requirements, we may block it from appearing, and in cases of repeated or egregious violations, we may stop you from advertising with us.
			<br>
			<br>Advertisers have a responsibility not to promote content or engage in behavior that risks harm to our users, employees, or the Ads ecosystem. If we see such content or behavior, we may take action, including but not limited to restricting or blocking your ads or suspending your account.
