			Hello there! My name is Justin and I am a Filipino student of Pasay City West High School, a photographer, song composer of LRT and MRT and rail enthusiast. I'm always ride LRT-1 because I'm enjoying ride LRT of cool air conditioning, fast speeds and safe.
			<br>
			<br>When I was 9 years old in 2016, I like trains and to draw so I can sketch my first LRT train without proper drawing because of my age.
			<br>
			<br>In 2017, I had composed my first LRT-1 song titled <i>20 Stations of LRT-1</i> after I heard the song <i>The Twelve Days of Christmas</i> from the FM radio while holding my LRT and MRT system map.
			<br>
			<br>The closing party on March 28, 2019, performed at 4th floor of Welcome Plaza, Taft Avenue, Pasay City, I'm sing the song <i>20 Stations of LRT-1</i> and my classmates of Grade 5 section Maunawain are so happy and giving me a loud applause.
			<br>
			<br>The song <i>20 Stations of LRT-1</i> was released on March 30, 2019 while the second song <i>13 Stations of MRT-3</i> in April 2, 2019.
			<br>
			<br>My YouTube channel named Justin LRT was created on November 15, 2020. I'm always uploading Minecraft videos to grow my channel and get more views amd subscribers. I'm so happy that the video hits 100 views for the first time. And my song I also uploaded it.
			<br>
			<br>My first trainspotting video I've uploaded on YouTube was on September 14, 2021. In March 2022, I'm now uploading train videos instead of Minecraft due to growing of views from the average of 40-80 views per day, its now 90-300 views per day.
			<br>
			<br>In June 2022, my video titled <i>MRT-3 in 4-car configuration</i> reached 1.5k views, this is my first time having more views in just 1 month. The MRT-3 ad wrap is back on August 8, 2022, so I upload the video taken on August 17, 2022 with title of <i>MRT-3 train with ad wrap spotted at Cuabo station</i> and it was reached 1k views in just 6 days.
			<br>
			<br>In August 19, 2022, my first time to go to Pasay City West High School to search my name and I find out what is my section and room in the school's gymnasium. I'm so happy about the first face-to-face classes after 2 years.
			<br>
			<br>In August 23, 2022, the first day of face-to-face classes, I'm so happy to see my classmates and teachers. Unfortunately, the class suspend at 1:52 PM due to heavy rain. Beside of that, my YouTube channel reach 600 views a day in my whole YouTube channel history and there some complains about me that the video was I uploaded is stolen from Facebook group named PTERC. Soon, I'm waiting months to do next.
			<br>
			<br>My first trainspotting video at EDSA-Taft Pasay Rotonda was on November 10, 2022. I'm so excited because I can now doing trainspotting activities in that place.
			<br>
			<br>My first LRT-1 ride in November 17, 2022 from Libertad to EDSA after 4 years. I'm was looking in whole stations and trains to see how good the LRT-1 is.
			<br>
			<br>I'm always taking pictures and videos of LRT because they're supporting me.
