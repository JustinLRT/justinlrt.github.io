			Hello there! My name is Justin and I am a famous and well-known student of Pasay City West High School, a photographer, song composer and rail enthusiast. I'm always ride LRT-1 because I'm enjoying ride LRT of cool air conditioning, fast speeds and safe.

			<h2>Educational background</h2>
			I attended P. Villanueva Elementary School from kindergarten to Grade 6. Learning was challenging, but I still enjoyed the many gatherings and parties.
			<br>
			<br>In 2020, I enrolled in Grade 7 at Pasay City West High School. Due to the pandemic, learning was difficult. Without AI or assistants, I had to complete printed modules on my own. Some modules were challenging to fill out due to difficult questions. Unfortunately, I received low grades in this educational system.
			<br>
			<br>In August 2022, I was excited to return to in-person classes. I adapted well to the new environment, earned higher grades, and learned more effectively.
			<br>
			<br>Currently, I'm a Grade 11 student pursuing the ABM (Accountancy, Business, Management) strand. I aspire to become an accountant so I can build and manage my own business.

				<br>
			</div>
			As a student, I'm so exciting in every class because after 2 years of pandemic caused by COVID-19, I finally meet my classmates, friends and even going somewhere. I'm was placed at top 8 in my class because I study hard and I'm doing great at school. I'm so good at drawing, drafting, and lettering since the start of school year.
			<br>
			<br>In every time to go to school, I'm so happy because I can meet all of my friends and to doing vlogging as well.
			<br>
			<br>I'm study harder to pass. It's not easy to study because you meed to focus what are the activities are coming. Failure is a success, meaning if you failed in the test or you got low grades the coming quarters will be increase the grades and scores. I am one of the honor student in my school.

					<br>
					<br>I've start photographing in 2021 because of beautiful view outside at top of my house. When the face-to-face classes starts after 2 years, I'm now able to get pictures and videos anywhere.
					<br>
					<br>As of 2024, I took many photos in many places in Luzon.

					The most popular song ever I created, Light Rail Transit Line 1.
				</div>
				<br>
			</div>
			As a child, I developed a passion for singing. I learned to mimic the voices of singers over the tv series.
			<br>
			<br>In 2017, I composed a song titled <q>20 Stations of LRT-1</q> by using a rail map and drawing inspiration from <q>12 Days of Christmas.</q>
			<br>
			<br>On March 28, 2019, I performed <q>20 Stations of LRT-1</q> for the first time at a closing party in Welcome Plaza, Pasay City. The song gained some popularity until 2022.
			<br>
			<br>In 2023, I decided to discontinue <q>20 Stations of LRT-1</q> because I realized it was a plagiarism and too long.
			<br>
			<br>I created a new song titled <q>Light Rail Transit Line 1</q> based on my experiences riding the train for over a year. The song was released in February 2024 and has garnered over 64,000 views.
			<br>
			<br>My largest concert was on April 4, 2024, during the Junior Prom. Students enjoyed hearing and singing <q>Light Rail Transit Line 1</q> for the first time.
			<br>
			<br>Finally, the song <q>Light Rail Transit Line 1</q> was the top 1 Philippine's railway song in 2024.
			<br>
			<br>I continue to compose new songs for everyone in the Philippines and in the world.

			<h2 id="section-4">Rail enthusiast</h2>As a rail enthusiast, I'm always taking pictures and videos mostly in LRT-1 and rarely in LRT-2 and MRT-3, because this my part for growing my content and make money. In every school class, I'm always staying at EDSA–Taft Pasay Rotonda for trainspotting and I'm always ride LRT-1 from Libertad to EDSA.
			<br>
			<br>My hobby for being railfan was decreased in 2024 due to my new location that I never go and ride LRT-1 after school.
