		<div class="content">
			<br>Pasay City West High School has a rich history dating back to its establishment in 1949 when it was known as Manuel L. Quezon High School. At its inception, the school operated with only nine teachers, a clerk, a janitor, and a modest 234 students. These early days were characterized by resource constraints, but the institution's commitment to education was unwavering.
			<br>
			<br>In its inaugural year, students of various ages from Pasay City attended classes in an old building divided into nine classrooms. Despite the limited resources, the first year marked a resounding success. Over the next two school years, enrollment surged by nearly 100%, drawing students not only from Pasay City but also from neighboring Manila and municipalities like Makati, Parañaque, Taguig, Las Piñas, and Muntinlupa.
			<br>
			<br>As the number of enrollees continued to grow, significant challenges arose. The school faced the daunting task of accommodating more students and providing adequate teaching staff. Nevertheless, city officials, led by the late Mayor Carlos Revilla, remained undaunted. They raised funds from various sources, securing a 10,292 square-meter lot along FB Harrison Street. A year later, a 23-room school building was erected, inaugurated on August 25, 1952, with then Vice President Fernando J. Lopez as the guest speaker.
			<br>
			<br>However, as more schools adopted the name of President Manuel Quezon, a decision was made to rename the institution. Under the leadership of Mr. Bernardo A. Fajardo, the first Principal, the school achieved new heights over eighteen years.
			<br>
			<br>Mrs. Anita H. Pizarro succeeded Mr. Fajardo, taking the helm of leadership. Under her tenure, the school witnessed significant growth, with added classrooms, hired teachers, and improved facilities. Yet, the enrollment continued to rise, necessitating further expansion. This led to the creation of Pasay City East High School in Malibay District and Pasay City South High School in Nichols Air Base, which later became Villamor Air Base.
			<br>
			<br>The school has remained a pillar of education in Pasay City, maintaining its reputation as a leader among public secondary schools. Over 75 years, it has evolved, adapted, and flourished. Today, Pasay City West High School, in addition to its Regular Program, offers Special Programs such as Science, Technology and Engineering (STE), Special Program in Foreign Language (SPFL) in German and Mandarin, Open High School, and Alternative Learning System (ALS) for Out of School Youths.
			<br>
			<br>Through the dedication of its leaders, educators, and students, Pasay City West High School continues to provide quality education and uphold its legacy of excellence in Pasay City's educational landscape.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Renaming</h2>
			In 1952, Manuel L. Quezon High School was renamed to Pasay City High School after the other schools were named after the late President Manuel Quezon, school officials proposed to the city council to change the name of the institution under Resolution No. 145.
			<br>
			<br>The creation of two annexes which is the Pasay City East High School and Pasay City South High School (now Villamor Air Base) led to be renamed from Pasay City High School to Pasay City West High School in 1967.
