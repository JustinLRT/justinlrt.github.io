		<div class="content">
			<br>Pasay City West High School has a rich history dating back to its establishment in 1949 when it was known as Manuel L. Quezon High School. At its inception, the school operated with only nine teachers, a clerk, a janitor, and a modest 234 students. These early days were characterized by resource constraints, but the institution's commitment to education was unwavering.
			<br>
			<br>In its inaugural year, students of various ages from Pasay City attended classes in an old building divided into nine classrooms. Despite the limited resources, the first year marked a resounding success. Over the next two school years, enrollment surged by nearly 100%, drawing students not only from Pasay City but also from neighboring Manila and municipalities like Makati, Parañaque, Taguig, Las Piñas, and Muntinlupa.
			<br>
			<br>As the number of enrollees continued to grow, significant challenges arose. The school faced the daunting task of accommodating more students and providing adequate teaching staff. Nevertheless, city officials, led by the late Mayor Carlos Revilla, remained undaunted. They raised funds from various sources, securing a 10,292 square-meter lot along FB Harrison Street. A year later, a 23-room school building was erected, inaugurated on August 25, 1952, with then Vice President Fernando J. Lopez as the guest speaker.
			<br>
			<br>However, as more schools adopted the name of President Manuel Quezon, a decision was made to rename the institution. Under the leadership of Mr. Bernardo A. Fajardo, the first Principal, the school achieved new heights over eighteen years.
			<br>
			<br>Mrs. Anita H. Pizarro succeeded Mr. Fajardo, taking the helm of leadership. Under her tenure, the school witnessed significant growth, with added classrooms, hired teachers, and improved facilities. Yet, the enrollment continued to rise, necessitating further expansion. This led to the creation of Pasay City East High School in Malibay District and Pasay City South High School in Nichols Air Base, which later became Villamor Air Base.
			<br>
			<br>The school has remained a pillar of education in Pasay City, maintaining its reputation as a leader among public secondary schools. Over 74 years, it has evolved, adapted, and flourished. Today, Pasay City West High School, in addition to its Regular Program, offers Special Programs such as Science, Technology and Engineering (STE), Special Program in Foreign Language (SPFL) in German and Mandarin, Open High School, and Alternative Learning System (ALS) for Out of School Youths.
			<br>
			<br>Through the dedication of its leaders, educators, and students, Pasay City West High School continues to provide quality education and uphold its legacy of excellence in Pasay City's educational landscape.
			<br>
			<br>
			<h2>Renaming</h2>
			In 1952, Manuel L. Quezon High School was renamed to Pasay City High School after the other schools were named after the late President Manuel Quezon, school officials proposed to the city council to change the name of the institution under Resolution No. 145.
			<br>
			<br>The creation of two annexes which is the Pasay City East High School and Pasay City South High School (now Villamor Air Base) led to be renamed from Pasay City High School to Pasay City West High School in 1967.

				<li>On November 29, 2022, two men in room in 9-Kamagong engaged in a fight even though there was a teacher present during the last period (between 4:40 PM - 5:30 PM). Both individuals were subsequently taken to the guidance office and suspended for three school days.</li>
				<li>On June 14, 2023, Grade 11 students turned off the circuit breaker on the 2nd floor of Building 3, near the stairs next to room 208, resulting in a blackout in rooms 205 to 208. A Grade 9 student entered the TLE Practical Arts faculty room, and it was then realized by the teachers that the Grade 11 students were responsible for the blackout. The teachers, who are professionals in electrical matters, restored the electricity by turning the circuit breaker back on, much to the delight of the students in rooms 205 to 208.</li>
				<li>On June 15, 2023, at 10:19 AM, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake with its epicenter in Calatagan, Batangas, caused panic at the school. Classes were immediately suspended, including the afternoon sessions, starting at 10:20 AM. The school's engineering and disaster response teams inspected buildings and structures to ensure safety.</li>
				<li>On September 13, 2023, some Grade 10 students were found using illegal drugs and vaping inside the restroom. Most of these students were from sections Agoncillo, Gomez, Malvar, and Jaena. On the same day, two female Grade 10 students were caught vaping in the women's restroom and posted a video on TikTok while wearing the school uniform of PCWHS. Due to the severity of these violations, the school dismissed the students mentioned above.</li>
				<li>On October 13, 2023, at 8:24 AM, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake originating from Calaca, Batangas prompted students to evacuate to the school's open space area for safety. The School Risk Management Council conducted inspections of the classrooms to assess for any potential wall cracks. By 9:00 AM, following directives from the Pasay City School's Division Office, the school principal issued instructions for students to return to their classrooms, and classes resumed as scheduled. No injuries were reported in this incident.</li>
