			After the frequent updates of LRT-1 and Pasay City West High School, we started to create own content about that. Our homes became filled with talk of train ride, trainspotting, updates, announcements, schools, and many more.
			<br>
			<br>We wanted to save ourselves the trouble of insufficient followers and views for people to view about LRT-1 and PCWHS, so we came up with the idea to create a website with everything that we had looked about the LRT-1 and PCWHS. So we got the people and students involved and created justinlrt.github.io.
