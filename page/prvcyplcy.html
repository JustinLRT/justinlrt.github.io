			<h2>Our Commitment to You</h2>
			Justin LRT is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. It is important for you to understand what Personal Information we will collect, how we will use it and who may see it.
		</div>
		<div class="box2">
			<h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>
			Personal Information is information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
			<br>
			<br>We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized or aggregated so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific natural person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.
